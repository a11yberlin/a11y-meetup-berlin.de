At least that is true for the lucky majority of the population who either have no issues with their eye sight or just don't like to use the keyboard. Remaining people depend, or are just in love with pressing keys. This talk is not about their struggle, it's about how-to implement the inclusion on the tech level."

We’ll take the amazing opportunity to meet on the Global Accessibility Awareness Day to discuss how accessibility blends into inclusive design, and what it means to design for all people."
