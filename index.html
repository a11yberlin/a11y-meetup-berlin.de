            text="Going international can reap huge financial benefits for a company. But internationalising your product is not as simple as just translating a couple of texts. In order to make it accessible, you need to localise the entire experience. In this talk, we’ll be looking at a case-study to explore some of the less obvious requirements of an internationalisation project."

We’ll take the amazing opportunity to meet on the Global Accessibility Awareness Day to discuss how accessibility blends into inclusive design, and what it means to design for all people."
