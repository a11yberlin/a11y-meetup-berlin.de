    {% include teaser.html headline="No more excuses: getting to the first 30%"
    subline="Tim von Oldenburg (Senior UX Engineer at ResearchGate)" text="Only
    30% of accessibility issues on a website can be caught by automated testing,
    according to the GDS accessibility team. But those 30% are a great baseline
    to operate from, and we should strive to make it as easy as possible for
    everyone to get there. In this talk, Tim will tell the story of how they’re
    trying to get to the first 30% at ResearchGate: how they approached those
    issues, the obstacles they’re facing, and what new exciting possibilities
    await them in the future." link="https://twitter.com/sweeneytimm" %}
