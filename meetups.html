            subline="Svenja Heinecke & Sebastian Felix Zappe"
            text="Since Wheelmap was launched in 2010, a mapping crowd consisting of thousands of people from all over the world has contributed more than 830,000 ratings on the wheelchair accessibility of public places. Facing the demands of keeping a simple UX design, sorting a jungle of data licenses and data sources and eyeing the ultimate goal of “disability mainstreaming”, the Wheelmap team has started the project “Accessibility Cloud”. With this new infrastructure, we are exploring new solutions for creating a bigger impact for accessibility mapping outcomes. Svenja and Sebastian will give you an insight into the status quo and the latest community and IT developments."

            subline="Stefan Judis"
            text="Building products for the web means building products for everybody. We spend hours and hours on optimising user flows, tweaking designs and A/B testing the heck out of everything. The problem is that we as developers, product owners and designers often think about the targeted customer under optimal conditions and ignore minorities. In this talk, Stefan will take a look at common problems of the web today and demonstrate how we can make it a more welcoming place."
