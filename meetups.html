      logistical and cultural constraints of an international online shop"
      subline="Matthias Kentzia (Product Manager, Project A)" text="Going
      international can reap huge financial benefits for a company. But
      internationalising your product is not as simple as just translating a
      couple of texts. In order to make it accessible, you need to localise the
      entire experience. In this talk, we’ll be looking at a case-study to
      explore some of the less obvious requirements of an internationalisation
      project." link="http://mattkentzia.com/"

      the age of the touch screens" subline="Develoger (Front-end Developer,
      Smava)" text="Mass consumption of the Internet started with a click. At
      least that is true for the lucky majority of the population who either
      have no issues with their eye sight or just don't like to use the
      keyboard. Remaining people depend, or are just in love with pressing keys.
      This talk is not about their struggle, it's about how-to implement the
      inclusion on the tech level." link="https://develoger.com/"

      author, speaker, N26)" text="We all know that accessibility should be
      baked in all our projects. But what is it even? This topic is so wide that
      it is sometimes hard to grasp. We’ll take the amazing opportunity to meet
      on the Global Accessibility Awareness Day to discuss how accessibility
      blends into inclusive design, and what it means to design for all people."

      reader is the most popular tool used by people with visual impairments to
      browse the web. As a rule screen readers have a quite high learning curve
      due to their complexity and different (non-visual) approach of getting
      information. In this presentation you will figure out best practices of
      navigating web pages with a screen reader, learn how to use those
      practices for accessibility testing on both Mac OS and Windows and
      understand how to avoid the most common pitfalls when getting started
      using a screen reader." link="http://sergeikriger.com/"

      defining a better design and development strategy for creating accessible
      websites and apps. Fortunately, there are tools that can help us improve

      of places with the help of people and technology" subline="Svenja Heinecke
      & Sebastian Felix Zappe" text="Since Wheelmap was launched in 2010, a
      mapping crowd consisting of thousands of people from all over the world
      has contributed more than 830,000 ratings on the wheelchair accessibility
      of public places. Facing the demands of keeping a simple UX design,
      sorting a jungle of data licenses and data sources and eyeing the ultimate
      goal of “disability mainstreaming”, the Wheelmap team has started the
      project “Accessibility Cloud”. With this new infrastructure, we are
      exploring new solutions for creating a bigger impact for accessibility
      mapping outcomes. Svenja and Sebastian will give you an insight into the
      status quo and the latest community and IT developments."

      means building products for everybody. We spend hours and hours on
      optimising user flows, tweaking designs and A/B testing the heck out of
      everything. The problem is that we as developers, product owners and
      designers often think about the targeted customer under optimal conditions
      and ignore minorities. In this talk, Stefan will take a look at common
      problems of the web today and demonstrate how we can make it a more
      welcoming place." link="https://www.stefanjudis.com/"
