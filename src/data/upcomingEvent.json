      "text": "Only 30% of accessibility issues on a website can be caught by automated testing, according to the GDS accessibility team. But those 30% are a great baseline to operate from, and we should strive to make it as easy as possible for everyone to get there. While every situation is different and every project faces unique challenges, the basics are often the same: we start small and try to scale our testing approach. We need to integrate new accessibility testing tools into our existing processes and pipelines. And we need the test results to be actionable and easy to understand. In this talk, Tim will tell the story of how they’re trying to get to the first 30% at ResearchGate: how they approached those issues, the obstacles they’re facing, and what new exciting possibilities await them in the future.",
