A11y Meetup Berlin is designed to bring together the accessibility, web
performance, and inclusive design community to share and discuss ideas, best
practices, and experiences. We would love to invite everyone interested in
these topics.

## What does "a11y" mean?

In short, a11y means “accessibility”. a11y is what is known as a numeronym,
somewhat similar to an acronym. Essentially, numbers are used in place of
letters to achieve the desired result. You may be familiar with other
numeronyms, such as “K-9” for “Canine” or “W3C” for “World Wide Web
Consortium”.

There are a number of ways a numeronym can be created. In the case of
translating “accessibility” to “a11y”, the first and last letters of
“accessibility” are preserved, replacing the remaining letters between with
their sum total, 11.

One of the guiding reasons for this is the limited space available on
social media platforms for posting content. For example, on Twitter - where
the character limit was 140 (until November 2017) - by replacing the
hashtag #accessibility with #a11y, the author now has another 9 characters
available to them. Easily enough for another one or two important words on
the subject of accessibility.
