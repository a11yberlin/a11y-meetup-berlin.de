Thank you for considering to take part in A11y Meetup Berlin, we're very excited to read your talk proposal!

## Topics

We welcome everyone who would like to share ideas, learnings, developments related to web accessibility, inclusive design, and other disability support services.

## We can help

One of our missions is to encourage new speakers and speakers from underrepresented groups to prepare and present their talks!
We would be happy to brainstorm your ideas, to review and advise you on how to produce a slide deck. We can also arrange a rehearsal via video chat with you.

## Guidelines

- Language: all talks are in English.
- Talk duration: talks should be 20 – 30 min long. Please be sure that your talk is within this limit.
- Experience level: everyone is welcome, from complete beginners to conference veterans.

## Equipment

The venue is equipped with a projector (1920x1080 native resolution) which has HDMI, VGA, and Mini DisplayPort connectors.
There are a wireless microphone headset and variety of multiport adapters e.g. USB Type-C to HDMI (please let us know upfront).

We have the ability to record, edit, and publish all talks. The main motivation is everyone in the community to benefit from the shared ideas and insights.

Since you retain full ownership of your slides and recording, we’d like to ask you to make your materials and recording available under a Creative Commons or another open source license.
